Istio addresses the challenges developers and operators face as monolithic applications transition towards a
distributed microservice architecture. To see how, it helps to take a more detailed look at Istioâ€™s service mesh.

The term service mesh is used to describe the network of microservices that make up such applications and the
interactions between them. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and
manage. Its requirements can include discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A
service mesh also often has more complex operational requirements, like A/B testing, canary rollouts, rate limiting,
access control, and end-to-end authentication.

Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole, offering a complete
solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications.

## Requirements

In order to install the Istio package, it's required to have installed the [init](./init/README.md) package.
This is the one involved in the Istio CRDs creation.

```bash
$ kustomize build katalog/istio/init | kubectl apply -f -
$ kubectl -n istio-system wait --for=condition=complete job --all
job.batch/istio-init-crd-10-1.4.2 condition met
job.batch/istio-init-crd-11-1.4.2 condition met
job.batch/istio-init-crd-14-1.4.2 condition met
```

Once installed, the cluster will be ready to install the [minimal](#minimal-installation) Istio deployment.


## Modular

Istio has a lot of features powered by a high number of pieces. This package has been designed to be installed from the
minimal installation providing basic features like traffic routing to a more complex deployment including
more features.


### Minimal installation

The [minimal](minimal/README.md) deployment is a perfect starting point to play with Istio. It deploys the basic
components that empowers features like traffic management, network resilience and testing and policies.

This package is the base where different components will be plugged.

[Example kustomize installation file](../../examples/istio/minimal/kustomization.yaml):

```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio
```

### Telemetry

[Telemetry](telemetry/README.md) is the istio component involved in the process of metric recollection.

Example kustomize installation file:

```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio
  - katalog/istio/telemetry
```

#### Service Monitors

As telemetry exposes metrics in prometheus format, this package provides the service-monitor definition for the
prometheus operator.

Example kustomize installation file:

```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio
  - katalog/istio/telemetry/service-monitor
```

##### Note

This package will deploy telemetry + service monitors. If telemetry it's already deployed, replace the telemetry base
with the `katalog/istio/telemetry/service-monitor` base.


### Egress Gateway

This package deploys on top of the [minimal installation](#minimal-installation),
[the egress gateway component](egress-gateway/README.md).

Once deployed this package, don't forget to deploy the new Istio configuration based on the components installed:

[Example kustomize installation file](../../examples/istio/minimal-and-egress/kustomization.yaml):

```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio/minimal
  - katalog/istio/egress-gateway
  - katalog/istio/sidecar-injection/configuration/minimal-and-egress
```

### Citadel

Citadel is the Istio component in charge of provide security features *(key and certificate management)*.
If you are looking for mTLS, this is the component you should install.

As the other components, this one should be installed on top of the minimal istio deployment.

Example kustomize installation file:

```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio/minimal
  - katalog/istio/citadel
  - katalog/istio/egress-gateway
  - katalog/istio/sidecar-injection/configuration/citadel-and-egress
```

In this example you can see istio + citadel + egress gateway installed.

##### Note

Be sure to deploy the correct `sidecar-injection/configuration` kustomize project. In this example the correct
configuration is the one with [citadel + egress](sidecar-injection/configuration/citadel-and-egress).


### Sidecar injector

Sidecar injector is the component responsible of injecting the envoy proxy on every required pod. This is the
alternative of executing `istioctl inject` comamnds.

Sidecar injector package requires [citadel](citadel/README.md) installed.

Example kustomize installation file:


```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio/minimal
  - katalog/istio/citadel
  - katalog/istio/egress-gateway
  - katalog/istio/sidecar-injection
  - katalog/istio/sidecar-injection/configuration/sidecar-injection-and-egress
```

In this example you can see istio + citadel + egress gateway and the sidecar injector installed.

##### Note

Be sure to deploy the correct `sidecar-injection/configuration` kustomize project. In this example the correct
configuration is the one with [sidecar-injector + egress](sidecar-injection/configuration/sidecar-injection-and-egress).

### Kiali

Kiali is a project used to visualize the service mesh in a graphical way. It needs metrics stored in a prometheus
server. So it requires to have installed telemetry package + optionally the service-monitor subpackage.

Example kustomize installation file:

```yaml
namespace: istio-system

bases:
  - katalog/istio/init
  - katalog/istio/minimal
  # - katalog/istio/telemetry
  # Will help if you have prometheus-operator deployed
  - katalog/istio/telemetry/service-monitor
  - katalog/istio/kiali
  - katalog/istio/sidecar-injection/configuration/minimal
```

#### Configuration

Kiali is configured with some default (unsecure) configuration. Please go to the Kiali package documentation to know
to change it.
