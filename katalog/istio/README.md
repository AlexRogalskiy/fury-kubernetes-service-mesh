# Istio

Istio addresses the challenges developers and operators face as monolithic applications transition towards a
distributed microservice architecture. To see how, it helps to take a more detailed look at Istioâ€™s service mesh.

The term service mesh is used to describe the network of microservices that make up such applications and the
interactions between them. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and
manage. Its requirements can include discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A
service mesh also often has more complex operational requirements, like A/B testing, canary rollouts, rate limiting,
access control, and end-to-end authentication.

Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole, offering a complete
solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications.
